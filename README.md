To setup a server take a look at the `BOOTSRAP` script and run it if you want.

Then you should call something like:
```
go build and ./three-thirteen
```

Then in your browser you can try:
```
https://localhost:8080/3-13/?create=test&players=a,b,c
https://localhost:8080/static/test.htm
https://localhost:8080/3-13/test/a/?marshal=0
https://localhost:8080/static/test.htm
https://localhost:8080/3-13/test/
https://localhost:8080/3-13/?list
```
and some other calls.
